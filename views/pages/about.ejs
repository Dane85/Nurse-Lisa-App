Though I have explored in other areas, I have always come back to Mental Health as my passion. Despite my love for this area of nursing, I decided It was time venture out and explore another area I â€˜ve always wanted to pursue, Medical Aesthetics. As such, I decided to enroll at the Canadian Association for Medical Aesthetics, where I took a comprehensive course on basic and advanced injecting. I can truly say that I have finally found my calling and a rejuvenated love for nursing through injecting. Following completion of my studies, I took a mentorship to continue to develop and build upon the skills I had learned in my courses. Through this, process I have learned so much and am excited to work with my clients to achieve their own cosmetic goals.</p>
